Consider a tuple of integers to represent a rational number, such that the numerator is the first of the tuple and the denominator the second.
Write a function that will calculate the simplest form of such a tuple and also rewrites any negative tuple such that the minus sign is present in the numerator.
You assume the denominator is unequal to zero.

simplify :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)

For Example:

> simplify (2, -4)
((-1),2)

and:

> simplify (-6,-9)
(2,3)
